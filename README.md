# Simple Shell

A basic Unix-like shell implemented in **C**, supporting the execution of various CLI (Command Line Interface) commands. This project was built to deepen our understanding of process creation, input/output redirection, and command parsing at the system level.

## Features

- Execution of built-in and external CLI commands
- Support for basic commands like `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `exit`, etc.
- Command parsing with arguments
- Error handling for invalid commands
- Custom shell prompt
- Built with C and standard Unix system calls

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Unix-like operating system (Linux/macOS)
- Git (optional, for cloning)

### Compilation

```bash
gcc -o simpleshell main.c
